# Intro

Envoyauth's purpose is to authenticate for envoyproxy. Incoming requests to envoyproxy will first be send to envoyauth for authentication and authorization.

## Authentication

Authentication works by XXXX

## Envoyauth endpoints

Envoyauth exposes multiple endpoints:

| name      | scope   | protocol | purpose                                     |
| --------- | ------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| webadmin  | private | http     | admin console, prometheus metrics, etc      |
| envoyauth | private | grpc     | authentication requests by envoyproxy       |
| oauth     | public  | http     | requests for [OAuth2 access tokens](#OAuth2)|

For each there is a corresponding `<endpoint>.listen` config field option to set listening address and port.

Scope:

- _private_, must not be exposed outside the deployment itself.
- _public_, meant to be exposed on public internet.

## Deployment

### Configuration

Envoyauth requires a startup configuration which needs to be provided as YAML file, see below for the supported fields. For an example configuration file see [envoyauth.yaml](../deployment/docker/envoyauth.yaml).

The configuration of envoyproxy to have it forward requests to envoyauth for authentication is done by envoycp.

### Envoyproxy

Envoyproxy's authentication configuration is pushed by envoycp, envoycp's configuration section `xds.extauthz` determine whether it's enabled, what the clustername, timeouts, etc.

The envoycp section `xds.extauthz` contains parameters like:

- `enabled` envoyproxy-wide switch to enable or disable forwarding requests to envoyauth
- `cluster` name of cluster which runs envoyauth
- `timeout` maximum allowed duration of authentication requests to envoyauth
- `failuremodeallow` in case envoyauth fails should requests be forwarded or not
- `requestbodysize` number of bytes of the request body envoyproxy should forward to envoyauth. This is a prerequisite for envoyauth being able to inspect the body of a request.

These configuration paramters get pushed out to every new envoyproxy instance.

#### Enable authentication for a route

By default authentication for a route is disabled. To have Envoyproxy forward request to the authentication cluster set [route attribute](api/route.md#Attribute) `Authentication` to `true`. The name of the authentication cluster is configured as `envoyproxy.extauthz.cluster` in envoycp's configuration.

### OAuth2

Envoyauth supports issueing and authentication using [OAuth 2 Client Credentials](https://aaronparecki.com/oauth-2-simplified/#client-credentials) mode. Two entities need to be configured:

1. A route that forwards the paths `oauth.tokenissuepath` and `oauth.tokeninfopath` to an OAuth cluster. Authentication should be disabled as OAuth2 endpoints are meant to be public.
2. A cluster that accesses envoyauth on port `oauth.listen`, to make sure OAuth requests go to this public endpoint of envoyauth.

Example route entity:

```json
{
    "name": "oauth2",
    "displayName": "OAuth2 authentication service üëçüèº",
    "RouteGroup": "routes_443",
    "path": "/oauth2",
    "pathType": "prefix",
    "attributes": [
        {
            "name": "Authentication",
            "value": "false"
        },
        {
            "name": "Cluster",
            "value": "oauth2"
        },
    ],
}
```

Example cluster entity:

```json
{
    "name": "oauth2",
    "displayName": "OAuth2 token API",
    "hostName": "envoyauth",
    "port": 4001,
    "attributes": [
        {
            "name": "TLS",
            "value": "false"
        }
    ],
}
```

### Caching

Envoyauth has a built in-memory cache for retrieved entities from Cassandra. This will prevent doing Cassandra queries for entities that has already been retrieved earlier to speed up authentication requests.
